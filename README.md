# Mainly it's my hobby.
Thanks to all my loving keyboards developers.

In keyboard, keep it so i do not forget that and help someone worried about that's keyboard keymaps.

QMK Configurator is the best for setting own keymaps, but it can not edit my rotary encoder action.
So if we want to edit that, mostly keep editing own keymap.c, it is so lazy.
It is fact that there are some people who are good at explaing how to do that.
I know they are very nice, kindness, and powerfull.
But in case of me(or someone who new to that hobby),I can not tell them, ask something or ask question(expect faults)frankly.

So keep it here for me...
